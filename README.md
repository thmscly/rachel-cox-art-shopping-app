This is a React shopping cart e-commerce app built to showcase and sell my wife's art.

It's currently deployed through Netlify, and can be found here:https://rachelcoxart.com/

It was done following tutorials with personalized built-from-scratch elements, and is intended to include the following tools:

    1. React
    2. Stripe
    3. JSX

As of this commit, the app is still a work-in-progress.

This app is intended to showcase my journey learning the robustly powerful front-end tool React.

Please feel free to send a message or a PR, and I'd be happy to chat with you.
